# GNN
This repository comprises the following GNN(Graph Neural Network)-related examples:

ExplainTwitch: A Simple Example to Show How to Explain Graph Neural Networks using GNNExplainer over Twitch Dataset.

MPGNN: Molecule Prediction with Graph Neural Networks.

NCGNN: Node Classifier Graph Neural Network, A Simple Example of Node Classification with GNN There are two special properties we are dealing with in this example:
- We have one large graph and not many individual graphs (like molecules),
- We infer on unlabeled nodes in this large graph and hence perform node-level predictions --> We have to use different nodes of the graph depending on what we want to do.

SGNN: Supervised Graph Neural Network, A Simple Example of Supervised Learning with GNN.

TGNN: Temporal Graph Neural Network, A Simple Example.
